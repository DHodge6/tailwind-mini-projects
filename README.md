# ðŸŒŸ Tailwind CSS Mini Projects

A growing collection of small, focused UI components and layouts built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  
Created while learning from Brad Traversy's [Tailwind From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/) course.

Each project is self-contained with an `index.html`, uses the Tailwind CDN, and is deployed via GitHub Pages for live preview.
