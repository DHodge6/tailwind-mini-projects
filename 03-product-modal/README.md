## 🔍 What I Practiced

- Coordinating multiple responsive layouts using `flex-col` and `md:flex-row`
- Creating hover-based animations with `group` and `group-hover`
- Aligning and spacing internal components with `items-center`, `space-y`, and `space-x`
- Designing CTA buttons with hover transitions and accessibility-friendly contrast
- Structuring modular UI blocks that could scale into a full product page
